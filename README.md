Foreword
========

This is a fork of the original [erlmpd](https://github.com/caolan/erlmpd)
library by [Caolan](https://github.com/caolan). The original README content
is kept in `README-original.txt` and reads as follows:

> A simple client library for communicating with MPD (<http://mpd.wikia.com>) -
> "a flexible, powerful, server-side application for playing music"
>
> To build just run make, this will create a doc directory which should
> contain a useful reference to the functions exported by the erlmpd module.
>
> This module was developed on Erlang R13B, should you encounter any problems
> I'd like to hear from you. Please get in touch via Github, or find me on
> Twitter at <http://twitter.com/caolan>
>
> Peace âœŒ

Introduction
============

This repository provides a pure Erlang client library for the
[MPD (Music Player Daemon) Protocol](https://mpd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html).

It does not expose the entirety of the protocol's capabilities but is
structured in a way that new API commands can be added easily.

The version provided in this repository has major changes compared to the
original version but still strives to be API compatible for the endpoints that
are exposed in the original version already.

Getting Started
===============

Assume your MPD runs on `127.0.0.1:6600`, you can get started interactively
with the library as follows:

~~~
$ rebar3 shell
===> Verifying dependencies...
===> Analyzing applications...
===> Compiling erlmpd
Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.1.5] [source] [64-bit] [smp:36:36] [ds:36:36:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]

Eshell V13.1.5  (abort with ^G)
1> {ok, Conn} = erlmpd:connect("127.0.0.1", 6600), erlmpd:status(Conn).
[{repeat,false},
 {random,false},
 {single,false},
 {consume,false},
 {partition,<<"default">>},
 {playlist,2},
 {playlistlength,514},
 {mixrampdb,<<"0">>},
 {state,pause},
 {song,504},
 {songid,505},
 {time,298.48},
 {elapsed,<<"298.218">>},
 {bitrate,0},
 {duration,<<"480.026">>},
 {audio,<<"44100:16:2">>},
 {nextsong,<<"505">>},
 {nextsongid,<<"506">>}]
~~~

This demonstrates establishing a connection with `erlmpd:connect/2` and
then querying of the status with `erlmpd:status/1`. For interactive usage it
is important to remember that there is a short timeout before the connection
cannot be used anymore, hence in the example, the status is queried from within
the same line.

To make use of the library in a rebar3-enabled project, declare a dependency to
it as follows:

~~~
{deps, [
	{erlmpd, {git, "https://github.com/m7a/bo-erlmpd.git", {branch, "master"}}},
]}.
~~~

...or pin it to a commit ID or branch (e.g. `masysma_changes`) as preferred.

There is currently no release schedule where stable versions could be obtained
from.

Documentation
=============

To generate the API documentation, run

	make -C src ../doc/erlmpd.html

It results in a directory `doc` being created which contains an API
documentation generated from the source code under `src/erlmpd.erl`.

A (potentially outdated) copy of the generated documentation can also be
found on the website: <https://masysma.net/32/erlmpd_att/erlmpd.html>.

Repository Structure
====================

The files in the repository are structured as follows:

~~~
bo-erlmpd/
  |
  +-- erlmpd_att/            -- documentation resources
  |
  +-- src/
  |    |
  |    +-- erlmpd.erl        -- core of the implementation
  |    |
  |    +-- ...               -- OTP auxiliary files
  |
  +-- support/
  |    |
  |    +-- include.mk        -- Makefile snippet/original build instructions
  |
  +-- rebar.config           -- Manifest for rebar3 integration
  |
  +-- README.md              -- Ma_Sys.ma-provided README documentation
  |
  +-- README-original.txt    -- Original README documentation
  |
  +-- debian-changelog.txt   -- Files related to MDPC 2.0 Debian Package
  +-- build.xml                 Build (probably not needed by most developers)
  |
  +-- LICENSE                -- GPL v3 copy
~~~

Branch Management
=================

There are two relevant branches in this repository:

 * `master` -- This is the working state with all Ma_Sys.ma changes including
   those which may primarily be of internal interest (MDPC 2.0 integration,
   website integration, ...)

 * `masysma_changes` -- This is the branch that had originally been intended
   as a pull request to the original repository. As a result, it contains less
   customization and e.g. retains the original README and build instructions
   as-is, mostly only adding to the existent code.

My current development approach is to attempt to implement all features and
bug fixes on branch `masysma_changes` and then merge them into `master`.

The default `master` should be OK for many use cases. It contains more code,
though. If an auditable change history is of importance to you, consider using
the `masysma_changes` branch directly.

MDPC 2.0 Integration
====================

If all of the necessary dependencies are installed, you can build a Debian
package for this repository by running the following command:

	ant package

Contact and Future Directions
=============================

The original code worked well even after 15 years of not being changed at all.
Hence I expect this library to not require frequent changes. When client
development requires access to them, new API functions can of course be added.
